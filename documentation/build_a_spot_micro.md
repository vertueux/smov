# Build a Spot Micro

> **Important**: It is recommended to find the center of your servos before building the robot: [Click here](calibrate_servos.md) to find and apply the center to your servos.

If you don't already have a Spot Micro build, I suggest you follow the [SpotMicroAI community](https://spotmicroai.readthedocs.io/) tutorial to build one.
Visit [this page](https://spotmicroai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingStarted/) to get started.

If you already have a Spot Micro build, you can skip straight to [the next stage](test_demos.md).

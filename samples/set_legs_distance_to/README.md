# The "Set Legs Distance To" package

> **Note** : You need to configure the `std::array` `data` with your own values in order to make it work properly.

## Run it

You can choose the distance you wish to put between your two legs:

```bash
ros2 run set_legs_distance_to state [distance]
```

For example,

```bash
ros2 run set_legs_distance_to state 14 # in centimeters.
```

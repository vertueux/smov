To install and configure the SMOV, I recommend that you control the robot remotely from your computer, using [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) or other remote services.
Here are the steps you need to follow to install and configure the SMOV executables on your robot's motherboard:

1. [Build a Spot Micro](build_a_spot_micro.md)
2. [Install ROS2](install_ros2.md)
3. [Install libraries](install_libraries.md)
4. [Configure ports (optional)](configure_ports.md)
5. [Calibrate servos](calibrate_servos.md)
6. [Test demos](test_demos.md)
7. [Create your own State package (optional)](create_your_own_state_package.md)

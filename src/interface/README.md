> The Interface sub-directory

## Overview

The Hardware subdirectory contains all the packages providing some form of interface, either with another component or with an API.

This subdirectory currently contains two packages: 

* `The States package`: Depends on the Board package. It provides an initial overview of complete robot control in real time.
* `The Monitor package`: This package is made to control the LCD screen on the back of the robot and display messages on it.

> The Source Code sub-directory

## Overview

This folder contains all the source code for the SMOV robot.

> **Note**: Everything is prefix with smov_ as most ROS2 projects involve using the default folder structures and building within it. This makes it easy to identify which packages are smov_native and which are created by those using it.
